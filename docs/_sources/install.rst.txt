Installation 
============

First, use:: 

  git clone https://github.com/rafaela-felix/pyddt.git

for obtaining the source code. Then, installing pyddt by executing::

  pip install .

inside the source folder on the command line.


Python package configuration
----------------------------

Considering that pyddt has been installed in a directory unknown to your Python distribution, you have to indicate Python where to look for it. So, you might:

* add the installation directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
* add the path to *sys.path* in the *.pythonrc* file placed in your home directory.
* add the path to *sys.path* in every script where you want to use the package before importing it

.. code-block:: python

  import sys
  sys.path.append("path to pyddt")
  import pyddt


Testing 
-------

For now, pyddt does not contain formal tests. If you can run the tutorial notebooks, you have successfully installed the package.
