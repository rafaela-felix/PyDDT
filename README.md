# PyDDT

Python package PyDDT (Python Dynamical Diffraction Toolkit) provides tools 
for structural modeling, planning experiments and posterior analysis of 
Renninger scans. The package enables quick check-ing on the feasibility of 
the probe on a specific structural detail, besides semi-automatically analysis
of hundreds multiple diffraction cases in a short period based on transferable 
asymmetry assessment method.
